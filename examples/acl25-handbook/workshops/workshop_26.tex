Description: WikiNLP invites researchers to contribute novel uses of Wikimedia data or studies of the impact of Wikimedia data within the NLP community. We will discuss tensions around multilinguality and concerns raised by generative AI. We will also highlight successful approaches to developing tooling that can assist the Wikimedia community in maintaining and improving the breadth of the Wikimedia projects.
