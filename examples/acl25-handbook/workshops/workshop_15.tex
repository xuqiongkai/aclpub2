Description: CoNLL is a yearly conference organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning), focusing on theoretically, cognitively, and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics.  In particular, it seeks to explore the interaction between theoretical issues in linguistics and cognition, on the one hand, and computational modeling, on the other.
