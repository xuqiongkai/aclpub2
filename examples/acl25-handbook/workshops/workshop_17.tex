Description: The Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) workshops focus on the evaluation and comparison of systems that
analyze diverse semantic phenomena in text, with the aim of extending the current state of the art in
semantic analysis and creating high quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging
problems in natural language semantics.
