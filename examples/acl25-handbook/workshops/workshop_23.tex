Description: Vast amounts of information today is being stored as videos with minimal text metadata, necessitating further research around the efficient discovery, understanding, and synthesis of multimodal collections. To address this need, the workshop on Multimodal Augmented Generation via Multimodal Retrieval (MAGMaR) workshop will focus on two primary areas: (1) the retrieval of multimodal content, which spans text, images, audio, video, and multimodal data (e.g., image-language, video-language); and (2) retrieval-augmented generation, with an emphasis on multimodal retrieval and generation.
