Description: "Tables are a promising modality for representation learning and generative models with too much application potential to ignore. The Table Representation Learning (TRL) workshop is the premier venue in this emerging research area and has three main goals:
(1) Motivate structured data (e.g. tables) as a primary modality for representation and generative models and advance the area further.
(2) Showcase impactful applications of pretrained table models and identify open challenges for future research, with a particular focus on progress in NLP for this edition at ACL in 2025.
(3) Foster discussion and collaboration across the NLP, ML, IR and DB communities."
