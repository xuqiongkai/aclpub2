This is a tutorial on the growing research area that combines eyetracking during reading with NLP. The tutorial will outline how eye movements in reading can be leveraged for NLP, and, vice versa, how NLP methods can advance psycholinguistic modeling of eye movements in reading. We will cover four main themes: (i) fundamentals of eye movements in reading, (ii) experimental methodologies and available data, (iii) integrating eye movement data in NLP models, and (iv) using NLP for modeling eye movements in reading. The tutorial is tailored to NLP researchers and practitioners, and will provide attendees with the essential background for conducting research on the joint modeling of eye movements and text.
